The purpose of this short course is to give students a conceptual and hands-on
introduction to the metabolomics workflow, experimental design process,
collection of data via LC combined with high resolution MS, data analysis
process, and compound identification.

Below is an overview of the material to be covered in this workshop. The top
toolbar has lecture material under the `Lectures` tab and Hands on activities
under the `Activities` tab.
