## How do we go from features to metabolites?

-   Individually (one feature at a time)
    -   Manual, very high confidence in ID
-   In bulk (many features at a time)
    -   Computational, generally lower confidence in ID

## Starting with a *m*/*z*

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 25px" .fragment}

-   A feature of interest differentially present in commercial vs. wild tomatoes.  We want to know what this is.
-   UHPLC-QTOF-MS, ESI+, reversed phase C18,mMethanol extract
-   A useful [adduct calculator](https://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/staff/kind/Metabolomics/MS-Adduct-Calculator/)
