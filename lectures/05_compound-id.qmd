## How do we go from features to metabolites?

-   Individually (one feature at a time)
    -   Manual, very high confidence in ID
-   In bulk (many features at a time)
    -   Computational, generally lower confidence in ID

## Starting with a *m*/*z*

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 25px"}

-   A feature of interest differentially present in commercial vs. wild tomatoes.  We want to know what this is.
-   UHPLC-QTOF-MS, ESI+, reversed phase C18, Methanol extract
-   A useful [adduct calculator](https://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/staff/kind/Metabolomics/MS-Adduct-Calculator/)

## Search in MS databases - [HMDB](https://hmdb.ca/)

`Search` > `LC-MS Search`

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%" style="font-size: 20px" .fragment}

![Screenshot of an HMDB MS1 search](img/05/hmdb-search.png)
:::

::: {.column width="35%" style="font-size: 35px"}

-   Enter your mass and mode
-   Indicate adduct type (can put unknown if you don't know)
-   Select a mass error (5 ppm is good for a QTOF)
-   Search

:::

## Evaluate search results

Think about:

-   Which structures are plausible?
  -   Make sense in your biological system
  -   Make sense in your extraction
  -   Make sense based on retention time
-   Which adducts are more likely?
-   The top result is not necessarily your ID!

## Access or collection MS/MS fragmentation data

![MS/MS spectra of 1092.5590 at 65eV in +ESI](img/05/1092-msms.png)

## Download structure

[http://www.hmdb.ca/spectra/ms_ms/59530](http://www.hmdb.ca/spectra/ms_ms/59530 
) 

![Download an `.sdf` file of your structure](img/05/save-sdf.png)

## Import into ChemSketch

![Import your `.sdf` file into ChemSketch](img/05/chemsketch-open.png)

## Set ChemSketch to provide you structural information

::: {style="font-size: 25px"}
-   Select which parameters you want printed: `Tools` > `Calculate` > `Select properties to calculate` > Select "Molecular Formula", "Monoisotopic Mass", "[M+H]+"
-   Have ChemSketch calculate those parameters: `Tools` > `Calculate` > `Selected properties` > `Copy to editor`.

## Breaking bonds to rationalize fragments

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%" style="font-size: 30px"}

-   Use the eraser (delete) to break bonds (learn more here re: [using ChemSketch](https://www.acdlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/download/quickstart/draw/qsg_chemsketch_trial.pdf))
-   Select a bond and it will be deleted
-   The details will stay with the larger fragment. Highlight the smaller piece to recalculate parameters.
-   Account for any rearrangement or additions/subtractions

## How can we improve the confidence of our ID?

-   Reference against publicly available MS/MS spectra
-   Purchase authentic standard and compare
-   Synthesize standard, confirm by NMR, and hope you're right ðŸ¥¹
-   Compare to MS/MS spectra of similar compounds
-   Compare to a sample that you know has your compound of interest

## MS/MS online databases

-   Experimental spectra
-   Predicted spectra

## Do you need to have an ID to quantify?

#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(ggrepel)

acetoxytomatine_cfmid <- read_excel("data/acetoxytomatine-cfmid.xlsx")

to_label <- acetoxytomatine_cfmid %>%
  filter(intensity > 1.7)

acetoxytomatine_cfmid %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = m_z, y = intensity)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = m_z, xend = m_z, y = 0, yend = intensity)) +
  geom_label_repel(data = to_label, aes(label = m_z)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "m/z",
       y = "Intensity",
