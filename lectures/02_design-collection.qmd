## The idea behind design and sampling

-   The samples you choose should be representative of the broader population you wish to study
-   The variability between your groups should be due to your research question (and not some other thing)

## Types of replicates

-   Biological replicates
-   Technical replicates

## Sources of variation in samples

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 30px"}
Experimental (due to our question):
:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 30px"}
Non-experimental (due to things other than our question)

-   Personnel
-   Collection materials
-   Storage (e.g., freeze-thaw, age)
-   Instrument issues
-   Run order effects

Ideally, measurement variability \<\<\< sample variability

## What can we do to minimize non-experimental variation?

-   Consistency!
-   Choose appropriate controls
-   Ensure sample groups are handled in the same way
-   Randomize extraction order
-   Randomize run order
-   Run in one batch

## Quality control (QC) samples

-   How do we know if our data looks ‘okay’ if we don’t know what it’s supposed to look like?
-   Pooled QCs, commercial QCs, synthetic QCs

## Process/extraction blanks

-   To remove signal that comes from the non-sample parts of your extract, we run process blanks
-   These consist of all components of your extraction minus the sample
    -   If you are extracting tomato juice with methanol, you would instead take an equal volume of water and “extract” using the identical process
-   This allows the removal of signal coming from: tips, vials, extraction aids, solvents, tubing, your dirty MS source etc

## Run order

## QC samples should cluster together

## Collection variables to consider

-   Tubes
-   Storage
-   Freeze-thaw
-   Quenching

## Standarizing extraction amoung

Compare samples by:

-   Mass
-   Volume
-   Number of cells
-   Protein content
-   Some other thing?


## When starting a metabolomics study...

-   Purchase one lot of materials (solvents, reagents, vials etc.)
-   Store many, small volume aliquots to avoid freeze-thaw
-   Decide what your QCs will be and act accordingly
-   Be consistent – generate a plan! 
-   Be especially careful when conducting a secondary analysis of already collected data
